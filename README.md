# CS-A-Level-Project
Firmware (arduino) and software to control a layered statue similar to Franz Kafka's statue in Prague.

This was created as my final project for the AQA Computer Science A-Level in 2017.

Firmware was created for Arduino.
Software was created with Visual Studio C# for Windows.

### Features: (as good as I remember since this was some time ago)
* Created a custom programming model for the movement of the layers.
* Users could code each layer's movements using the programming model I created (with parameters such as rotating speed, direction and degrees).
* Each sequence could be saved and opened at a later time to run.
* Serial communication between PC and Arduino.
* Can control motors from more than 1 Arduino.
* This was tested on a small scale statue, but my solution could be used to control a bigger statue.

### Important: Please keep in mind that I coded this on my own with only a couple years of programming experience. The code could be buggy and messy.
